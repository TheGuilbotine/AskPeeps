</p>

- All pages have a footer with links to the creators GitHub and Linkedin accounts as well as links to their other projects.

- The Feed Page allows users to view the questions feed, click to see responses to each question and add their own responses. They also have their own questions sidebar where they can see the questions they have asked as well as ask their own question. They can edit or delete any question or response they have asked.

</p>

- This is essentially a one page app. All of the actual app interaction will happen in the feed page.

## Challenges
- Currently trying to make only responses for the question clicked to show rather than all responses for all questions.
- Some rerenders were diffiuct to implement smoothly, but eventually were mastered with interesting fetch calls in Thunks because of the nested nature of responses in questions coming from the backend.
